Welcome to the ultimate tool for efficient and automated token distribution across blockchain wallets! Our platform is designed for projects, DAOs, and blockchain-based organizations that need to distribute tokens to thousands of wallet addresses with ease. Beyond that, it empowers users with advanced integrations with DeFi protocols for staking, liquidity farming, and automated payments.

## *IMPORTANT*
This bot is designed for automatic multi-distribution of tokens from the owner's wallet, with confirmation from the deployed smart contract of the token. 
This means that only the creator and owner of the token can perform the distribution.

## Key Features
1. Send tokens in bulk: Send tokens to multiple addresses at once with a single request.

2. Bulk Token Distribution: Instantly distribute tokens to thousands of wallets with just a few clicks. Supports major blockchains including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Avalanche, and more.

3. Optimized Gas Fees: Efficient transaction processing with built-in gas optimization, supporting Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync to lower costs.

4. DeFi Protocol Integrations:
   - Liquidity Provision: Automatically add tokens to liquidity pools on platforms like Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap.
   - Staking & Yield Farming: Seamlessly stake tokens or participate in yield farming on Aave, Compound, Yearn Finance, and more.
   - Recurring Payments: Set up automated recurring payments using Superfluid and Sablier, enabling streaming payments for payrolls or reward systems.

5. Advanced Automation:
   -Set up automatic liquidity farming strategies.
   -Reinvest farming rewards directly into pools or staked positions.
   -Automate token exchange on DEXs (1inch, Uniswap) for more flexibility.

6. Multi-Chain Support: Full compatibility with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Avalanche, and many others, allowing easy cross-chain operations.

7. Real-Time Monitoring & Reporting: Track all your transactions and DeFi operations in one place. Export detailed reports for auditing and analysis.

8. Support for various tokens: Works with ERC-20, BEP-20 and other token standards.

9. Intuitive interface: Easy-to-use interface for setting up and running bulk shipments.

10. Configuring transaction parameters: Ability to set transaction fees and other parameters.

11. Status Tracking: Receive notifications on the status of every transaction sent.

## Main functions of the program

1. Connecting to blockchain

2. Import and manage wallets:
   - Ability to import multiple wallet addresses for token distribution.
   - Storing private keys in a secure format.

3. Customize the mailing parameters:
   - Specify the number of tokens to send to each address.
   - Setting limits on the number of transactions per minute (to avoid blocking).

4. Monitoring the status of transactions:
   - Tracking the status of each transaction and displaying information about successful and unsuccessful shipments.

5. Logging:
   - Maintain a log of all transactions for further analysis.

6. User Interface:
   - User-friendly GUI for configuring mailing parameters and displaying the status of operations.

## Setup Programm
1. Creating a smart contract
  You need to create a smart contract that manages tokens and access to the mailing function.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    address public owner;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }

    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        owner = msg.sender;
        _mint(owner, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }

    function massTransfer(address[] calldata recipients, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        for (uint i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
            _transfer(owner, recipients[i], amount);
        }
    }
}

2. Access control
   In this example, the massTransfer function can only be called by the owner of the contract (the address that created it). This is ensured by using the onlyOwner modifier.

3. Using a private key
   The private key should not be stored in a smart contract. Instead, it should be stored securely on the client side (e.g., in a wallet). Your client side (e.g. dApp) should use this key to sign transactions.

4. Token distribution
   When you want to do a mass token distribution, your client code must call the massTransfer function, using the address of the contract owner to send the transaction.
